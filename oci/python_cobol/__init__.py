"""
This package contains the Python-Cobol pic parser written by
Brian Peterson (https://github.com/bpeterso2000/pycobol) and enhanced
by Paulus Schoutsen (https://github.com/balloob/Python-COBOL/blob/master/cobol.py)

The only modifications done by the OpenCobolIDE team is to add support
for python3 and replace print statement with call to logging module. Those
modifications have been implemented on a fork of the Python-Cobol project,
maintained by the OpenCobolIDE organization: https://github.com/OpenCobolIDE/Python-COBOL

PLEASE, if you want to do any modification on the cobol.py script, do it
on the fork then copy the script here!!!
