Report bugs or ask a question
-----------------------------

You can report bugs or ask question on our `bug tracker`_.


Submitting pull requests:
-------------------------

Pull Requests are great!

    1. Fork the Repo on github.
    2. Create a feature or a bugfix branch before you start coding.
    3. If you are adding functionality or fixing a bug, please add a test!
    4. Add your name to AUTHORS.rst
    5. Push to your fork and submit a pull request to **the master branch**.

Please use **PEP8** to style your code (PEP8 compliance is tested Travis CI).

*You can check pep8 compliance before pushing by running the test suite with
the --pep8 option*::

    ($ pip3 install pytest-pep8)
    $ python3 runtests.py --pep8 -m pep8
